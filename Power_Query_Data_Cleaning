üè¢ Broker Performance Data Cleaning & Preparation (Power Query)
‚Ä¢	üìå Project Overview
‚Ä¢	In this project, I worked with a mock dataset simulating broker performance in an insurance brokerage. The dataset contained over 150 rows of data with intentionally introduced errors such as missing values, inconsistent date formats, duplicates, and outliers. The goal of this project was to clean, transform, and prepare the data for reliable reporting and dashboard creation.
üîß Key Challenges & Cleaning Steps
1.	Missing & Inconsistent Data
o	I filled in the missing values in Policies_Sold and replaced "N/A" values in Total_Premium with the average as a replacement value
o	I standardized inconsistent date formats in the Month column (e.g., "2023-01", "Jan-2023", "01/2023", "Unknown") into a uniform YYYY-MM format.

2.	Data Validation & Consistency
o	I checked and corrected cases where Claims_Paid exceeded Claims_Filed by adding a custom column to flag cases where business logic is broken.
o	I ensured Commission_Earned was within a reasonable ratio compared to Total_Premium to ensure commission earned was not greater than 50% of the Total Premium.

3.	Duplicate & Outlier Handling
o	I removed duplicate broker records by Broker_ID, Region, and Month.
o	I flagged brokers with unusually high Policies_Sold compared to their regional peers to identify outliers and highlight top performers versus typical ranges.

4.	Transformations for Analysis
o	I created new metrics such as Claims_Ratio = Claims_Paid / Claims_Filed.
o	I aggregated performance data by Region and Month.
o	I ranked brokers by Total_Premium and calculated average Client Satisfaction Score per region.

üîπ Bonus Transformation Tasks 
‚Ä¢	I created a new column Claims_Ratio = Claims_Paid / Claims_Filed.
‚Ä¢	I aggregated total Policies_Sold and Total_Premium per Region.
‚Ä¢	I Calculated the average Client Satisfaction Score per region per month.

üìä Outcome
After cleaning, the dataset was transformed into a structured, analysis-ready format. The cleaned data provided:
‚Ä¢	Reliable insights into broker productivity.
‚Ä¢	Regional comparisons of sales and claims performance.
‚Ä¢	A foundation for creating dashboards to track top performers and training needs.
üëâ This project demonstrates my ability to identify and resolve real-world data quality issues using Power Query, ensuring that stakeholders can trust the insights drawn from the data.
